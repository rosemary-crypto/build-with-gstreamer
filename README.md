# Build With GStreamer

Welcome to the **Build With GStreamer** repository! This project is part of a series of tutorials on GStreamer development, designed to help you learn how to build multimedia applications using the GStreamer framework.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code examples, configurations, and resources used in the tutorial series.

### Directory Structure

- **`gst-apps/`**: Contains the GStreamer applications demonstrated in the tutorials.
- **`resources/`**: Holds test videos, configuration files, and other resources needed to run the applications.
- **`gst-libs/`** (future): Will contain custom GStreamer libraries as the lessons progress.
- **`gst/`** (future): Will include additional GStreamer-related code and utilities.
